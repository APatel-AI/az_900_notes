# Domain 1: Describe Cloud Concepts
## 1.1 Describing cloud computing
- Cloud computing is a model for enabling universal, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider intteraction.

- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing serrvices over the internet
  - Expands the traditional IT offerings to include services like
     - Internet of Things (IoT)
     - Machine Learning (ML)
     - Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### Benefits of cloud computing: 
- cost-effective
- global
- secure
- scalable
- elastic
- always current
- In all, it allows organizations to transfer risk, operational responsibility, and to focus on innovation

### Public Cloud: Everything runs on your cloud provider's hardware.
  - Advantages: scalability, agility, PAYG, no maintenance, and low skills. Also you skip building your own datacenter
### Private Cloud: A cloud environment in your OWN datacenter
  - Advantages: legacy support, control, compliance
  - Legacy support: a feature that allows a computer system to use older hardware, software, or data.
### Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private clouds, allowing you to run your apps in the right location.
  - Advantages: flexibility in legacy, compliance, and scalability scenarios.
### Economies of Scale: The ability to do things more efficiently or at lower-cost per unit when operating at a larger scale.
### Capital Expenditure (CapEx): is the spendinf of money on physical infrastructure up front.
### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
  - spending money on services or products now and being billed as you go.
  - The cloud increases OpEx spending and reduces CapEx spending
### Consumption-based Model: Pay for what you use
### Fixed price model: you provision resources and pay for those instances whether you use them or not.
