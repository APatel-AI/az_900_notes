# Domain 1: Describe Cloud Concepts
## 1.1 Describing cloud computing
- Cloud computing is a model for enabling universal, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider intteraction.

- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing serrvices over the internet
  - Expands the traditional IT offerings to include services like
     - Internet of Things (IoT)
     - Machine Learning (ML)
     - Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### Benefits of cloud computing: 
- cost-effective
- global
- secure
- scalable
- elastic
- always current
- In all, it allows organizations to transfer risk, operational responsibility, and to focus on innovation

### Public Cloud: Everything runs on your cloud provider's hardware.
  - Advantages: scalability, agility, PAYG, no maintenance, and low skills. Also you skip building your own datacenter
### Private Cloud: A cloud environment in your OWN datacenter
  - Advantages: legacy support, control, compliance
  - Legacy support: a feature that allows a computer system to use older hardware, software, or data.
### Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private clouds, allowing you to run your apps in the right location.
  - Advantages: flexibility in legacy, compliance, and scalability scenarios.
### Economies of Scale: The ability to do things more efficiently or at lower-cost per unit when operating at a larger scale.
### Capital Expenditure (CapEx): is the spendinf of money on physical infrastructure up front.
### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
  - spending money on services or products now and being billed as you go.
  - The cloud increases OpEx spending and reduces CapEx spending
### Consumption-based Model: Pay for what you use
### Fixed price model: you provision resources and pay for those instances whether you use them or not. 
### Serverless Architecture: 
- A cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.
-  Hosted as a pay-as-you-go model based on use. Resources are stateless, servers ephemeral, and often capable of being triggered.
- Example: Function as a service

### PaaS vs Serverless

### WORD ASSOCIAITON: SERVERLESS
- LOGIC APP
- FUNCTIONS
- EVENT GRID

### Logic App
- A cloud service that helps you schedule, automate, and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows
- You can choose from a gallery of hundreds of pre-built connectors for MSFT & 3rd party services
- Logic App is the foundation for power automate (MS Flow)

### Functions
- An event driven, compute-on-demand experience that extends the existing Azure application platform with capabilities to implement code __triggered by events__ occuring in Azure as well as on-premises systems.
- This enables billing per execution rather than by time

### Event grid
- Enables you to easily __manage events__ across many different Azure services and applications
- Once a subscription is created, Event Grid will __push__ events to the configured destination
- Makes it easy for any developer to utilize the "push" model instead of the inefficient "pull" across their Serverless architecture.
- Like Azure functions, it is pay per use
